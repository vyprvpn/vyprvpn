<h3>SECURITY</h3>
We are using internet on daily basis but a very few people think about the security concern. 87% people think that they are not safe from the spies or hackers but beside that they don’t take such actions regarding the fact.

VyprVPN is using the PPTP, L2TP, OpenVPN and Chameleon protocol. The PPTP is not that much secure if you are using the basic version. Pro and Premier version uses the 256-bit encryption method to protect your data which is highly commendable. The chameleon technology allows you to mask your VPN traffic via Deep Pocket Inspection method. Rather it’s providing you with higher speed and durability. The NAT firewall is another defensive accomplishment from unbound data traffic.
